# Happy-Numbers

Run in the command prompt, enter an integer, or don't and you'll get an error. 

Basically, how this works is. 
1. Pick a number that is positive.
2. The number you picked will be replaced by the sum of squares of it's digits.
3. The same process for the new number.
4. If the number 1 is reached it is a 'happy number', otherwise it's an 'unhappy number.'
